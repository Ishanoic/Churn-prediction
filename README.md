# Churn Prediction for Video Streaming Service

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Science Coding Challenge! This project aims to predict churn for a video streaming service. Churn prediction is a critical task for subscription-based businesses to retain their customers effectively.

In this challenge, we utilize machine learning techniques to predict whether existing subscribers will continue their subscriptions for another month. The provided dataset contains valuable information about customers, their streaming preferences, and activity within the subscription.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing:** The dataset is thoroughly cleaned, preprocessed, and normalized to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Insights and visualizations help understand the dataset and make informed modeling decisions.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Various classifiers like Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Random Forest are trained and tested for predictive performance.
- **Predictions:** Model predictions are made and stored in a submission-ready format.

## Efforts and Technologies

- Extensive data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Utilization of popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.
- Implementation of advanced machine learning models to achieve high predictive accuracy.
- Thorough validation and visualization to ensure data quality and model effectiveness.

## Instructions for Submission

- The main predictions can be found in the `prediction_submission.csv` file.
- To explore the project, run the provided Jupyter notebook and follow the steps outlined within.
- Modify the models and preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Final Words

This project reflects significant efforts in data preprocessing, model selection, and predictive analysis. The aim is to provide an accurate churn prediction for the video streaming service, enabling targeted customer support and interventions.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project to achieve even better results!
